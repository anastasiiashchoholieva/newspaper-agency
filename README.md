# Newspaper Agency

## Project overview

As a chief in the newspaper agency, working with great team of Redactors, I decided to create website to track 
Newspapers, published by our agency, in a proper way.
For that purpose I decided to create a system for tracking Redactors, assigned to Newspapers.
So I will always know, who were the publishers of each Newspaper.
